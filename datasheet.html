          <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>For what purpose was the dataset created?</strong>
                    <p>The dataset was created to support the training of advanced generative models for facial analysis tasks, including facial recognition, expression analysis, and biometric authentication. The specific gap it aimed to fill was the lack of high-quality, annotated synthetic datasets that closely mimic real human facial features with minimal domain gaps. This was essential for developing models capable of performing accurately on real-world data using only synthetic training data.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)?</strong>
                    <p>This dataset was created by a collaboration of researchers from various institutions (Mercedes Benz R&D India; IIIT Hyderabad; Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Who funded the creation of the dataset?</strong>
                    <p>This dataset was supported by Mercedes-Benz Research & Development India through the access to resources such as GPU compute enabled servers to facilitate training and experiments.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
          
          <h3>Composition</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)?</strong> Are there multiple types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.
                    <p>The dataset comprises of face image data of synthetically generated human heads along with synthetically generated annotations in the form of PNG, TXT, and JSON files.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?</strong>
                    <p>The generated dataset which has been used for experiments comprises of 100k samples in the train set and 10k samples in the validation set. This amounts to 100k RGB images of 512x512 resolution of heads, 100k 512x512 images for semantic masks (in color), 100k 128x128 resolution depth maps, and 100k json files containing annotations related to the 68 facial keypoints.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?</strong> If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).
                    <p>Since the dataset is generated from the proposed pipeline presented in the paper, a significantly larger set can be generated with the accessible tools provided and there is no theoretical limit on the number of samples that could exist in the large set.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>What data does each instance consist of?</strong> “Raw” data (e.g., unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.
                    <p>Each frame instance is a set of the RGB image, semantic mask, depth, and keypoint annotations. There is no separate format of the data.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Is there a label or target associated with each instance?</strong> If so, please provide a description.
                    <p>There are multiple labels associated with each image instance. (i) The depth map is generated from the volumetric rendering stage in the final stage of the Next3D generator, (ii) The semantic labels are pixel-level descriptors about part of face such as skin, eyes, head, upper lip, lower lip, nose etc., (iii) the 68 facial landmarks along the face edge, eyes, nose, and mouth. These can be used to train multi-task networks on downstream tasks.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Is any information missing from individual instances?</strong> If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g., redacted text.
                    <p>No. All information extracted from the proposed pipeline are present in the dataset and annotations.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (e.g., users’ movie ratings, social network links)?</strong> If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.
                    <p>No such information is necessary in the proposed dataset.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training, development/validation, testing)?</strong> If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.
                    <p>Yes, we sample a 100k sized training dataset and a 10k sized validation dataset from the data generation pipeline for facilitating the experiments reported in the paper. Furthermore, more data can be sampled using the proposed approach.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset?</strong> If so, please provide a description.
                    <p>Yes, there are some minor misalignments in the annotations and the generated RGB image. These are due to the nature of the StyleGAN generator network used in the process. We have addressed the issue and steps taken to rectify these errors in the paper.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (e.g., websites, tweets, other datasets)?</strong> If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (i.e., including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (e.g., licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.
                    <p>The dataset is self contained and can be used for training facial analysis tasks. However, the dataset generation framework relies of FLAME and Next3D to enable training the models. These resources are available on archival forums and widely available, as per the details outlined in the paper and the code repositories or our work.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor– patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)?</strong> If so, please provide a description.
                    <p>No, since the dataset has been synthetically generated.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety?</strong> If so, please describe why.
                    <p>No, since the dataset has been synthetically generated and contains outputs from generative models that generate head images based on provided geometry, expression params, and latent variable alone.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Does the dataset identify any subpopulations (e.g., by age, gender)?</strong> If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.
                    <p>No, the dataset has been generated through a generator model trained on publically available FFHQ dataset which contains images from various groups.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Is it possible to identify individuals (i.e., one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (i.e., in combination with other data) from the dataset?</strong> If so, please describe how.
                    <p>No, since the dataset has been generated synthetically from a generative model.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (e.g., data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)?</strong> If so, please provide a description.
                    <p>No biometric level information is synthesized so there are no hallucinations towards identity specific information.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Collection Process</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>How was the data associated with each instance acquired?</strong> Was the data directly observable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.
                    <p>The dataset was directly generated using a pre-trained generative model which we modify to be able to extract annotations and semantic level information. The code and resources to generate more data is available through the project webpage and the paper.</p>
